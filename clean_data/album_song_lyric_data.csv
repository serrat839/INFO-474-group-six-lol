It's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me
Lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin'
The words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

And I'm the kind of person
Who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down

From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

Are kids in buses longing to be free

Let the century pass me by
Standing under night sky
Tomorrow means nothing

I was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car
And prayed to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing
La, la la, la la la la

I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down

So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

Now it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive

See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

I go out on my belly crawling
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC
I got the nightly news

All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your face in a locket
Picture in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it

I know these fast cars

Down a shady lane through the sugar cane;
He was lokking for his liking.as he roamed along he sang a songof the land of milk and honey,
Where a bum can stay for many a day, and he won't need any money.
Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
And the soda water fountain,
At the limonade springs where the bluebird sings
On the big rock candy mountain.

There's a lake of gin we can both jump in
And the handouts grow on bushes;
In the new mown-hay we can sleep all day,
And the bars all have free lunches.

Where the mail train stops and there ain't no cops
And the folks are tender-hearted,
Where you never change your socks and rocks,
And your hair is never parted.

Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
And the soda water fountain,
At the limonade springs where the bluebird sings
On the big rock candy mountain.

Oh, a farmer and his son, they were on the run,
To the hay field they were bounding.
Said the bum to the sun, ""why don't you come

Bye, bye

What will it be, some soothing herb tea?
That might be just the thing

Or else, maybe tonight a hand of solitaire

It's a luscious invention for three

I'm hanging just the same
I need to be in the heat

Stretching all the way from here and now to hell and gone

Just a thrill away from punching through to the cosmic wow

It started out good
Then it got lots better
Makin' up the rules as we went along
But with a business like this
There's a gnarly downside

I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood

Swingin' so hard
We burned right through the summer
Till the axis of pain/pleasure sheared the arc of desire

So I cannot let you come near

I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you have come and bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch your life walk by

Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyday surprises me

Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgement
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?

Always wanna take it to the full out extent

Always wanna make it seem like good intent
Never wanna face it when it time for punishment

Yo, now everybody tryin' to chart
C'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon, uhh
C'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon

Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin' no higher?

Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now, who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws
And does anything they feel just because
There's always someone there who'll applaud

Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire

I treat this like my thesis.
Well-written topic
Broken down into pieces.
I introduce then produce
Words so profuse.
It's abuse how I juice up this beat

Two people both equal.
Like I'm Gemini
Rather simeon.
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it.
You can't stop it.

Like particles while I make international articles.
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business.

First handed, I'm candid.
You can't stand it.
Respect demanded
And get flown around the planet.
Rock Hard Like granite or steel.
People feel like Lauryn Hill from New-Ark Israel.
And this is real.
So I keep makin' the street's ballads
While lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad.

You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.

I'm about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest.
I wrote the opus
To reverse the hypnosis.
Whoever's closest
To the line's gonna win it.
You gonna fall tryin' to ball
While my team win the pennant.

I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air
Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my heart's in the Highland
I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

Windows were shakin' all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol' rat race
Life in the same ol' cage

I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam
That's where I'll be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme
Well my heart's in the Highland
I can only get there one step at a time

I'm listening to, I gotta turn up the sound
Someone's always yelling, [""Turn it down!""]
Feel like I'm drifting
Drifting from scene the scene
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?

Insanity is smashing up against my soul
You can say I was on anything but a roll
If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top
What would I do with it anyway?
Maybe take it to the pawn shop

My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
Big white clouds, like chariots that swing down low

A young player, bred in South Central

You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag

I used to walk in stores and yell, ""Lay down""
You flinch an inch AK spray down
But I was lucky 'cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme

All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos

Fast lanin', but the car flipped

I'm not gonna lie to ya, 'cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say why?
'Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track

I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name

He told me, Ice, keep doin' what you're doin', man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let 'em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night

I'm on the wax, I'm on the stage, I'm on the scene

To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland to be with my brother man

Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Five thousand lightyears from Birdland
But I know people can hear it

Bird named it, Bird made it
Bird heard it, Then played it
Well stated
Birdland
It happened down in Birdland

In the middle of that hub
I remember one jazz club
Where we went to pat feet
Down on 52nd Street
Everybody heard that word
That they named it after Bird
Where the rythym swooped and swirled
The jazz corner of the world
And the cats they giged in there
Were beyond compare

Birdland, I'm singing Birdland
Birdland, Old swingin' Birdland

Hey man, the music really turns you on (ya turn me on)
Really? Ya turn me around
And turn me on

Down them stairs, Lose them cares

And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes

And still he can't decide

And it tears her up inside

She is scared,
Scared to run out of time

And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange

I've waited so long baby now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience and here's where my ends
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex
It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go?
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say No!

I want your sex, sex

You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I short of attention?

In that it's a very good example of how a collaboration works
Even when you're not aware of it occurring
The track is one of the early tracks
Because I only did five tracks in South Africa
On the sessions that I did with Forere
Who is the accordion player
Plays on ""Boy in the Bubble""
We did a few other tracks
One of the tracks, I said
""You know, I like only the drums on this track
I don't really want anything else
I don't want the accordion or bass
I just want the drums""

And the drums were...
Something like a kind of a traveling rhythm
In country music
I'm a big Sun Records fan
Early 50's, mid-50's Sun Records
You hear that drum beat a lot

Like a fast, Johnny Cash type of rhythm
And somewhere later in the week of recording
When I had, you know put together a rhythm section of Ray Phiri
And Bakithi Kumalo and Isaac Mtshali as the rhythm section
I said to Ray one day, ""I like this drum pattern
Take a listen to it and see if it does anything for you
You know it sounds kind of like a country thing to me""
So he starts to play his version of American country, Ray
He was in the key of E, and then he was playing, you know
Of course he's playing electric
But he'd be up over here, you know, like
And then the drums are going
Oh, then he went
Which is a relative minor chord to that key

I said, ""Hey, that's interesting that you played a minor chord""
Because all the music that I'd been recording with
In South Africa, with the exception of the Sotho music
It was all three-chord major chords
And there was never a minor chord
There were times when I'd ask Black Mambazo to sing a minor chord
They couldn't sing a minor chord

I wanna do all I can just to show you
Make you understand
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away

When you're in my arms
When I'm close to you
There's a magic in your touch that just comes shining through
Want you everyday

Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything

And if you feel alone
I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby who can really tell, when two hearts belong so well

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun refuse to shine
When I say 'i love you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time!
Baby, you gotta know
